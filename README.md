Chosen track: Help the community

Video Script:

Hello everyone, I'd like to introduce you to Maria, since quarantine started she has been receiving less, because the company she works for did the math and had to reduce her paycheck so they wouldn't have to fire anyone or shut down. She's eating more at home and desires to cook less and, she doesn't order online because in the long term delivery services costs too much. She decides to call her neighbor and ask him if he wants to order something from her favorite restaurant and split the cost of delivery, he accepts, and Maria can have a nice dinner without having to cook. 
Like Maria lots of people are having  more free time, and a sudden urge to save more money, so the tradeoff between cost and time is inclined towards time. With that in mind Logilivery is proposed as an app to plan your delivery with people near you, to reduce the costs of delivery. Logilivery shows you orders being planned close to you, so you can join someone's order, by checking if the day and time of arrival fits your interests, if it does, check the estimated cost for delivery, you can also check how many people are already in and how many are still considering. Or you can start a new order, with your favorite restaurant, a more convenient time, and ask people to join you.
Logilivery also encourages local businesses to be more creative and conquer more costumers. With the feature Local Patreon, local businesses can create new products, offer discounts and special treats to costumers that contribute with a monthly amount of money. It can be a special desert menu, a secret link to live shows that happens monthly, a surprise main entrance every time you order, or a 10% discount in each order for your loyalty and support, it's important to be creative! And support local businesses!!!

A few words from me: I tried to make an app but, couldn't finisih the most of it, so I'm just warning you to expect the beggining of an app in react native and frontend. I value group projects but I'm never good enough to take the most difficult techinical parts that I so need to improve, so I took it as an opportunity to develop my own skills, I very much appreciate the opportunity. Thanks SigmaHack!
